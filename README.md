# PEKI

- **P**enguins
- **E**pic
- **K**UAL
- **I**nstaller

## What It Does

1. PEKI can be used as a way to install KUAL without MRPI, then it will act as a launcher.
2. On kindles where KUAL is already installed, PEKI will delete the previous booklet and act as a launcher.
3. The upside of this is that PEKI has a nice icon :) And MRPI is known for it's quirks.
