# PEKI

- **P**enguins
- **E**pic
- **K**UAL
- **I**nstaller

## What It Does

1. PEKI can be used as a way to install KUAL without MRPI, then it will act as a launcher.
2. On kindles where KUAL is already installed, PEKI will delete the previous booklet and act as a launcher.
3. The upside of this is that PEKI has a nice icon :) And MRPI is known for its quirks.

## Installation

1. Grab the latest release
2. Unzip it, copy both the `KUAL.jar` and `KUAL.sh` into your `documents/` folder on your kindle.
3. Run it once, it will either install & run KUAL or delete the old booklet & run KUAL, making it the new launcher.
4. Have fun!
